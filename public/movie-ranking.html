<h2>My top 3 movies of all time, more or less</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</h3>
<p>There are no flaws in this epic Spaghetti Western></p>
<h3>Conan the Barbarian</h3>
<p>Beautiful images, awe-inspiring soundtrack, not much dialague needed. But the few lines that are spoken are memorable.</p>
<h3>Hero</h3>
<p>Artistic, philosophical, an Eastern masterpiece</p>
